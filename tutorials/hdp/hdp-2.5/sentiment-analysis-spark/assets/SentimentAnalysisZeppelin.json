In an ideal world we would prefer to have a large dataset where a group of experts hand-labeled each statement as happy or sad. Since we don't have that dataset we can improvise by streaming tweets that contain the words \"happy\" or \"sad\", and use the presence of these words as our labels. This isn't perfect: a few sentences like \"I'm not happy\" will end up being incorrectly labeled as happy. If you wanted more accurate labeled data, you could use a part of speech tagger like Stanford NLP or SyntaxNet, which would let you make sure the word \"happy\" is always describing \"I\" or \"I'm\" and the word \"not\" isn't applied to \"happy\".

This is extremely important, because a model can have very high accuracy when evaluating training data but fail spectacularly when it encounters data it hasn't seen before.\n\nThis situation is called ***overfitting***. A good predictive model will build a generalized representation of your data in a way that reflects real things going on in your problem domain, and this generalization gives it predictive power.
